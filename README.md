## Installation Instructions

To install the environment, follow these steps:

1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
   or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) on your system.

2. Save the provided environment YAML file as `environment.yml`.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `environment.yml` file is saved.

4. Run the following command to create the environment:
   > conda env create -f environment.yml

   This command will create a new environment named cvm with all the specified dependencies.

6. Activate the environment by running the following command:
   > conda activate cvm

7. Once activated, you can verify the installed packages with:
   > conda list

8. To deactivate the environment, you can run:
   > conda deactivate
