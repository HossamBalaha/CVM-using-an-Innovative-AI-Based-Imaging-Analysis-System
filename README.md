## Programming Language and Tools

This project is implemented using the Python programming language, utilizing the following libraries for various tasks
like numerical computation, data manipulation, machine learning, and image processing:

* NumPy: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical
  functions to operate on these arrays. It is widely used for numerical computations.
* Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library that allows for easy data analysis and handling of large datasets through
  its DataFrame object, which supports complex operations such as filtering, merging, and reshaping data.
* Scikit-learn: A widely-used library for implementing machine learning algorithms. It includes simple and efficient
  tools for data mining, data analysis, and model building. It also has utilities for preprocessing, model selection,
  and evaluation.
* Scikit-image: Provides a collection of algorithms for image processing. This library is built on top of NumPy and can
  handle tasks like image segmentation, geometric transformations, and feature extraction.
* Matplotlib: A data visualization library that provides tools for creating static, animated, and interactive plots and
  graphs. It is frequently used in scientific and engineering fields to visualize data.
* SciPy: A library used for scientific and technical computing. It extends the functionality of NumPy by providing
  additional modules for optimization, integration, interpolation, and other advanced mathematical functions.
* TQDM: A simple but versatile library for adding progress bars to loops in Python. It helps track long-running
  operations in a visually appealing way.
* Pydicom: A specialized library for reading and writing DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files,
  which are widely used for medical imaging data storage.
* Imutils: A library that simplifies common image processing operations such as translation, rotation, resizing,
  skeletonization, and displaying images. It’s built on top of OpenCV and makes working with image data more efficient.
* OpenCV: An open-source library that provides tools for real-time computer vision applications. It supports many image
  and video operations such as object detection, face recognition, and camera calibration.
* Pickle: A module for serializing (pickling) and deserializing (unpickling) Python objects. It allows for saving
  machine learning models, data structures, and other Python objects to disk for later use.
* LightGBM: A high-performance, gradient-boosting framework designed for speed and efficiency. It is commonly used in
  classification and regression tasks, particularly with large datasets.
* XGBoost: Another popular gradient-boosting library optimized for speed and performance. It is widely used in machine
  learning competitions due to its scalability and effectiveness in handling large datasets.
* CatBoost: A gradient-boosting algorithm designed to handle categorical features natively. It is particularly useful in
  datasets where many categorical variables are present, without the need for extensive preprocessing.
* Mahotas: A library focused on image processing, providing fast and efficient algorithms for image filtering, edge
  detection, and feature extraction. It is ideal for computationally demanding image analysis tasks.
* Flask: A lightweight web framework used to build web applications. It is commonly used for deploying machine learning
  models and integrating them into web-based platforms for easy access and interaction.
* Flask-WTF: An extension for Flask that simplifies the integration of web forms in Flask applications. It provides
  utilities for form validation, CSRF protection, and other form-related tasks.
