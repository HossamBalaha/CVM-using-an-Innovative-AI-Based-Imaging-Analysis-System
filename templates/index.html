              Dental malocclusion, which affects 20â€“83% of adolescents and adults, is characterized by misaligned teeth
              that impair masticatory function and cause aesthetic issues. Especially when considering adolescents,
              timely
              actions have the potential to prevent or hinder the progression of malocclusion in its early stages.

              For
              effective early intervention, estimating skeletal growth remaining for these patients is a crucial aspect
              of
              orthodontic treatment, particularly when jaw growth modification or orthognathic surgery is involved. Over
              the years, orthodontists have developed and utilized various methods to evaluate the developmental stage
              of
              orthodontic patients. In the past, skeletal age was used to determine a child's capacity for growth.
              Traditionally, <b>cervical vertebral maturation (CVM)</b> staging and assessment of hand-wrist bone age
              are utilized by dental practitioners.

              Adult orthodontic treatment has been increasingly popular in recent years, resulting in a scarcity of data
              on this patient population. It is essential to grasp the psychological attributes and incentives of every
              patient, given their potential substantial influence on both patient contentment and compliance with
              treatment. Therefore, in order to improve the patient's treatment experience and raise the probability of
              a successful treatment outcome, medical professionals must expand their understanding of this subgroup.

              Nevertheless, the need for extra radiographic tests with hand-wrist radiographs has led to hesitation from
              orthodontists and patients when considering this approach in orthodontic procedures. Fortunately, due to
              the possibility of evaluating CVM stages using lateral cephalograms, which are already essential for
              orthodontic analysis, the adoption of CVM staging has been increasingly favored within the orthodontic
              community. Lateral cephalograms are used to analyze the morphological characteristics of the second,
              third, and fourth cervical vertebrae, aiming to identify potential variations that could be utilized in
              estimating CVM.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              A modified version of the CVM approach was proposed by Baccetti et al. to identify the peak in mandibular
              development. In this research, an examination was conducted on the structure of the second, third, and
              fourth cervical vertebrae (depicted in the figure below on the left) using cephalograms from a group of
              390 individuals who had not received orthodontic treatment. This investigation spanned six successive
              observations. The novel CVM approach introduced in this study encompasses 6 distinct stages of maturation,
              labeled as cervical stages 1 through 6 (CS1 to CS6). The stages of cervical vertebral maturation are
              categorized into six stages depending on the vertebrae C2-C4 as presented in the figure below on the
              right.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              During the initial stage (CS1), the lower borders of vertebrae C2-C4 display a flat configuration, while
              the bodies of C3 and C4 take on a trapezoidal shape. After this stage, mandibular development peaks around
              two years later. In stage two (CS2), a concavity emerges at the lower border of C2, and the shapes of the
              C3 and C4 bodies remain trapezoidal. After this stage, mandibular development peaks around a year later.
              Advancing to stage three (CS3), concavities are observable in the lower borders of both C2 and C3. The
              bodies of C3 and C4 exhibit the possibility of being either trapezoidal or horizontally rectangular in
              shape. The peak of mandibular growth transpires within the year following this stage.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              Progressing to stage four (CS4), concavities manifest at the lower borders of C2, C3, and C4. The bodies
              of C3 and C4 transform into a horizontally rectangular configuration. Before this stage, the mandibular
              growth peaked during the previous year or two. Moving on to stage five (CS5), the concavities along the
              lower borders of C2, C3, and C4 persist. At least one of the bodies of C3 and C4 adopts a square shape, or
              alternatively, the other cervical vertebra retains a rectangular horizontal form. At least a year has
              passed since the mandibular development phase peaked. Finally, in the last stage (CS6), the concavities
              along the lower borders of C2, C3, and C4 remain discernible. At least one of the bodies of C3 and C4
              takes on a vertically rectangular shape, or the other cervical vertebra becomes square. At least two years
              have passed since the peak of mandibular development.
